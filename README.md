# MiX Moustacher

This project was created by the team of [MiX](http://mix.iminds.be "MiX") to feature at our booth on [iMinds The Conference](http://iminds.creativemediadays.be "iMinds The Conference").

The main purpose is to attract visitors with a funny gimmick: moustachify them! People take a picture of themselves with the built-in camera of a laptop. They use the controller on the iPad to enter their Twitter username and they publish it on our wall (our 55" television screen) and to Twitter.

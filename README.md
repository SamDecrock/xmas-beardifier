MiX Moustacher
==============

This project was created by the team of [MiX](http://mix.iminds.be "MiX") to feature at our booth on [iMinds The Conference](http://iminds.creativemediadays.be "iMinds The Conference").

The main purpose is the attract visitors with a funny gimmick: moustachify them! People take a picture of themselves with the built-in camera of laptop. They use the controller on the iPad to enter their Twitter username and they choose to publish it on our wall (our 55" television screen) and to Twitter.
